# Dryland Dynamics Model

## Summary

The [dryland dynamics model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580906001250) is an agent-based simulation of spatial dynamics of vegetation in arid conditions. The environment is a grid of cells, representing a square piece of land. Each cell can either be degraded {-}, empty (unoccupied) {0} or vegetated {+}. The possible transitions are:

 - degraded to empty: {-} to {0}
 - empty to degraded: {0} to {-}
 - empty to vegetated: {0} to {+}
 - vegetated to empty: {+} to {0}

## How to Run

Launch an interactive server by Running ``run.py``:

```
    $ python run.py
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) move sliders to set the parameters and press Reset, then Run. 

To view and run the model analyses, use the ``Analyse`` Notebook.

## Files

### ``ecosystem/agent.py``

The agent class is called **Patch**. Each Patch object is placed on the grid, and its condition is assigned at the model initialization based on user-specified parameters. Its transitions between different states are governed by the rates calculated at each step. 

### ``ecosystem/model.py``

The **EcoModel** class is the model container. It is instantiated with parameters ``b`` - plant establishment probability of an empty site, ``m`` - mortality probability of a vegetated site, and additional parameters found in the accompanying ``config_file.json`` file. 


### ``ecosystem/server.py``

This code defines and launches the in-browser visualization for the model. Each cell is a rectangle, with a color based on its condition. *Vegetated* sites are green, *Empty* sites red, and *Degraded* sites are black.

### ``ecosystem/config_file.json``

This file contains initial parameters for the model simulation.
